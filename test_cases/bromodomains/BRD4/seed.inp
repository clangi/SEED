#           List of points (e.g. ligand heavy atoms of a known ligand-receptor 
#           complex structure) in the binding site used to select polar and apolar 
#           rec. vectors which satisfy the angle criterion (see parameters file)

#           Metals in the binding site
#           Make sure that the residue number of the metal is in the
